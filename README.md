This repository contains scripts for running the analyses from "Many ways to mast: masting seeding is widespread across the plant Tree of Life but with minor macroevolutionary consequences", Dale et al. (submitted).

Decriptions of what the scripts do can be found in the headers of each file.
The analysis proceeds in the order that they are numbered. The non-numbered files contain functions used by the scripts above.
