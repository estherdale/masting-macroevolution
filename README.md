# masting-macroevolution
This repository contains scripts for running the analyses from "Many ways to mast: masting seeding is widespread across the plant Tree of Life but without macroevolutionary consequences", Dale et al. (submitted).

Decriptions of what the scripts do can be found in the headers of each file.
The analysis proceeds as follows:
1. Filtering MASTREE data.R
2. Standardising names and generating datasets.R
3. Masting macroevolution analyses full.R
4. Fig 2 script.R

The remaining files contain functions used by the scripts above.
